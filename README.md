# Convert-dict

This repo is to store code which can convert dictionary from [The People's Dictoinary](https://folkets-lexikon.csc.kth.se/folkets/folkets.en.html) and release converted dictionaries.

## Details

[About The People's Dictoinary](https://folkets-lexikon.csc.kth.se/folkets/om.en.html) can be downloaded in 2 formats, .xml has more informations but does not have available audio download urls, plus, .xdxf has better phonetic symbols. Above all, .xml and .xdxf are harder to read by softwares. This repo joins audio download urls and phonetic symbols from .xdxf into .xml dictionary, and converts the dictionary into .json format.
